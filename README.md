# TOP-Rock_Paper_Scissors
This is a project from The Odin Project named "Project: Rock Paper Scissors"

I'll use this read me file as place to stored the Problem solving approach.

First let's defined the Pseudo Code 

The computer gets a random choice from a function 
The user inputs the value of choice
The values are compared logically using general winning rules
The Console outputs both choices and the Winner 

This should be the whole senario
